          <h3>Local Measurement of Superconducting Penetration Depth</h3>
          <p>
            We can use our magnetic probes to measure the London penetration depth. This is the distance over which superconductors expel magnetic fields, and its chagne with temperatur can tell us about the superconducting state. So it is one of the first things to be measured in new superconducting materials. The twist is that our magnetic probes can measure the penetration depth locally, so we can test the uniformity of the sample, which is invisible to traditional techniques.

          <h3>Magnetic imaging of individual magnetotactic bacteria</h3>
          <p>
            Biotechnology represent a new and exciting application of SQUID microscopy. Several biomedical applications, such as bio-separation, MRI and drug delivery use nanomagnets. The magnetic properties of nanomagnets are usually measured in large groups, which can be problematic due to the large dispersion of their properties. Magnetotactic bacteria are a group of bacteria that naturally grow magnetic particles, which magnetically align along a chain and result in alignment of the bacteria with earth's magnetic field (like a compass needle). We use scanning SQUID to detect magnetotactic bacteria and measure their moment properties and their response to small fields on an individual basis. We observe large dispersion in their magnetic properties.

            We are developing the next generation of SQUID sensors and incorporating them into a new user scanning SQUID microscopy user facility at Stanford. The SQUIDs, designed at Stanford and fabricated at IBM's Josephson line in Yorktown Heights, NY, will combine tenth micron lithography with device planarization to produce devices with deep sub-micron spatial resolution. In addition, we have designed and are building SQUID samplers, which will sense repetitive magnetic fields with a temporal resolution of as low as 10 psec, and dispersive SQUIDs, which will have (calculated) spin sensitivities of an electron spin in a 1 Hz bandwidth.

          <h3>Modulated superfluid density in twinned high Tc superconductors</h3>
          <p>
            Several physical properties like the local strain, the bond angle, and the magnetic order may change on twin boundaries in orthorhombic crystals. These properties are known to affect superconductivity in bulk measurements. We use scanning SQUID to image the local magnetometry and susceptibility on the surface of twinned superconductors. We observe increased diamagnetic susceptibility in underdoped, but not overdoped, single crystals of the pnictide superconductor Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 , consistent with enhanced superfluid density on twin boundaries.

Interesting information is also acquired by following the vortex behavior. Individual vortices avoid pinning on or crossing the twin boundaries, and prefer to travel parallel to them. These results help us connect the magnetic properties with the local changes in the crystal.

          <h3>Vortex manipulation by MFM</h3>
          <p>
            Superconductors often contain quantized microscopic whirlpools of electrons, called vortices. Vortices are a diverse area of study for condensed matter because of the interplay between thermal fluctuations, vortex–vortex interactions and the interaction of the vortex core with the three-dimensional disorder landscape. We use magnetic force microscopy (MFM) to image and manipulate individual vortices in a detwinned YBa2Cu3O6.991 single crystal, directly measuring the interaction of a moving vortex with the local disorder potential.

We find an unexpected and marked enhancement of the response of a vortex to pulling when we wiggle it transversely. In addition, we find enhanced vortex pinning anisotropy that suggests clustering of oxygen vacancies in our sample and demonstrates the power of MFM to probe vortex structure and microscopic defects that cause pinning.

          <h3>Persistent Currents</h3>
          <p>
            Many people are familiar with the lorentz current induced in normal metals by a time varying magnetic field or the persistent shielding currents generated by superconductors in an applied field. However, a surprising theoretical prediction suggests a persistent current can be supported in a normal metal ring even with finite resistance. Specifically in the presence of a magnetic field if electrons can travel around the ring without losing their phase coherence a current is expected equal to one electron traveling at the fermi velocity.

However, a surprising theoretical prediction suggests a persistent current can be supported in a normal metal ring even with finite resistance. Specifically in the presence of a magnetic field if electrons can travel around the ring without losing their phase coherence a current is expected equal to one electron traveling at the fermi velocity. Measuring these currents using transport techniques is challenging because attaching leads to the ring changes the coherence of the electrons. We used our scanning SQUID to detect the small magnetic moment generated by the currents flowing in these rings.
